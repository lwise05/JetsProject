# JetsProject


## Description 
This program is an app that simulates an airfield with a fleet of 5 jets. The user is prompted with a menu to do the following actions: 
1. View the jets in the airfield
2. Make the jets fly
3. View the fastest jet in the fleet
4. View the jet with the longest range in the fleet
5. Have the cargo jets load cargo
6. Have the fighter jets start fighting
7. Construct and add new jets 
8. Remove specific jets
9. Exit the app

## Technologies Used
	* Java
	* Eclipse
	* Sublime
	* Git/GitHub
	* MacOS Terminal 

## Lessons Learned
I'm doing better at understanding/implementing different logic in for and for each loops. I surprised myself in how easy it came to me to build the add/remove jets logic into the arraylist. I'm really trying to implement different concepts that I'm not very comfortable with (using instance of, exceptions, try/catch blocks, parsing) to continue growing my understanding of how they work. I've also tried to take in account for user errors, like creating while loops with try/catch blocks incase the user entered in invalid data and is able to resubmit vs the program breaking/ending. I still get confused when calling different methods, for example referencing a class with a method (e.i. FighterJet.fight(); ) vs referencing an actual instance of that object to call the method. We also received assistance with setting up a file reader and buffered reader to take in a text file and later split it up to construct jets. I've go back to try and practice this concept in one of our labs but it's still something that I find difficult and would need assitance in.
